Question: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build
a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

Answer: Java will not allow user to do this , because if you create a constructor method to build a DVD by category and a 
constructor method to build a DVD by title , but Java define constructor by signature so when your run this program, Java
cannot define by parameter so the program will have eror: "constructor is already deffined"
